Below You can find exercises presented to me at one of my job interviews related to Data Science.

Solutions to tasks 1-3 are solved in folders named accordingly.

In 4th folder is a financial report written to the best of my ability at the time of writing it. I am unsure whether it presents valuable information due to my inexperience in that field.

Overall exercises were solved at satisfactory manner allowing me to take part in the next stage of recruitment process.
